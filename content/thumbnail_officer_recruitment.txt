A clean and professional layout featuring a background with a subtle gradient in shades of blue to evoke trust and authority. On the left side, include an illustrative icon or silhouette of a government officer or badge to immediately convey the recruitment theme. To the right or centrally positioned, place a bold banner with a megaphone icon indicating announcement or notification. Use dynamic lines or subtle accents to guide the viewer's eye toward the key message. Keep ample space around text for clarity. The overall design should be balanced, ensuring elements are not cluttered, with enough contrast for quick understanding on mobile devices.
