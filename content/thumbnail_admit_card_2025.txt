The thumbnail features a clean, professional layout with a focused central element. On the left side, include an upward-curving, semi-transparent blue background with an image of an official examination or hall ticket, slightly tilted for a dynamic feel. Overlay the ticket with a bold, red stamp that says 'Admit Card'. On the right side, display large text for emphasis, with a background gradient from light blue at the top to white at the bottom. Incorporate subtle icons like a calendar or checkmark to symbolize deadlines or confirmation. Use a subtle shadow behind main text for better contrast and readability. The overall layout ensures clear visual hierarchy, with key elements immediately visible even on small screens.
