The thumbnail features a clean, modern layout with a prominent, centered image of an official exam admit card or hall ticket, possibly with a subtle background of a classroom or exam hall to contextualize the theme. On the left or right side, include an upward-pointing arrow or a download icon to signify the 'download' action. The background uses a gradient or subtle pattern to maintain visual interest without overwhelming the main elements. To enhance readability, add a semi-transparent overlay behind the text. The overall composition balances elements for clarity and visual hierarchy, ensuring the design looks vibrant yet professional.
