The thumbnail features a clean, modern layout with a balanced composition. Background is a subtle gradient in dark blue and navy, creating a professional feel. On the left side, include an image or icon of a badge, police cap, or a gavel to symbolize authority and results. Centered prominently is a large, slightly tilted notification/checkmark icon or stamp to signify accomplishment or results. To the right, display a clear, sharp image of a police officer in uniform or an exam paper with 'Passed' or 'Results' stamped on it. The layout ensures key elements are not cluttered and remain visible on mobile devices. Use visual hierarchy to guide the viewer’s eye from the main icon, to the text, to supporting visuals.
