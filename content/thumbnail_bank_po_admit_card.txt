The thumbnail features a clean, professional layout with a focus on clarity and immediacy. Background has a subtle gradient transitioning from deep blue at the top to a lighter blue or teal at the bottom, symbolizing trust and authority. On the left side, incorporate an image of an official-looking admit card with a slight tilt for dynamic appeal. To the right, include a large, bold icon of a checkmark or a calendar to symbolize verification and exam readiness. The bottom area has a faint overlay of a silhouette of a government building or bank to contextualize the exam setting. Use slight shadows or borders around elements for depth, ensuring visibility on small screens.
