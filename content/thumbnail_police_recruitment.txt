The thumbnail features a bold, professional layout with a balanced composition. The background showcases a subtle Indian police badge or emblem, overlaid with a semi-transparent blue gradient to emphasize authority and trust. On the left side, include an image of a confident police officer in uniform, slightly angled to add dynamism. The right side contains a prominent text box with a clean, contrasting background. The overall layout is centered around clear hierarchy, with visual elements guiding the viewer's eye from the officer to the text. Incorporate subtle geometric lines or icons related to recruitment, like a checkmark or document icon, to add visual interest without clutter. The edges are slightly rounded to create a modern, friendly look that is appealing even on small mobile screens.
