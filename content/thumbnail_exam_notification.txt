The thumbnail features a bold, attention-grabbing background with a subtle gradient from deep blue at the top to a vibrant orange at the bottom, symbolizing urgency and importance. On the left side, include an icon or graphic representing exams or notifications — such as a paper with a checkmark or a megaphone alert icon — with a slight drop shadow for depth. The right side prominently displays the main text overlay in large, clear fonts. The layout is clean with ample white space to ensure readability. Add a small badge or ribbon at the top corner with 'Job Alert' or 'Exam Notice' to enhance urgency. Incorporate subtle dotted or chart-like lines in the background to suggest data and notifications, keeping the overall design professional yet eye-catching.
