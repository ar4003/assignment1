The thumbnail features a clean, professional layout with a bold background that transitions from a vibrant shade at the top to a slightly darker tone at the bottom. On the left side, incorporate a stylized checklist or list icon to symbolize results and merit lists. The right side prominently displays a large, attention-grabbing box or banner with a semi-transparent overlay for the main text. The text area includes subtle accent lines or icons such as checkmarks or exam-related symbols to reinforce the theme. The overall composition maintains ample whitespace to ensure clarity and avoid clutter, with elements scaled for mobile readability. The top corner may include a small logo or branding element for credibility, without overpowering the main visual. Use contrasting elements to draw viewersâ€™ attention immediately. Ensure the design does not sacrifice clarity when scaled down for mobile screens.
