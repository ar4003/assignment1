The thumbnail features a clean, professional layout with a balanced composition. On the left side, include an iconic image representing government or employment, such as a government building or a briefcase with a flag overlay. The right side contains bold, large text overlay for high visibility. Use a subtle gradient background transitioning from deep blue at the top to lighter blue at the bottom, giving a trustworthy and authoritative feel. Incorporate subtle icons like checkmarks or document symbols near the text to emphasize notifications. Maintain ample white space around the main elements for clarity and mobile readability. The overall look should be sharp, modern, and engaging, ready to attract clicks while conveying trustworthiness and importance.
