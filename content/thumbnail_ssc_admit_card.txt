The thumbnail features a clean and professional layout divided into two main areas. On the left, prominently display a high-quality, close-up image of an official SSC admit card slightly angled for a dynamic look, with a subtle glow or highlight to attract attention. Overlay a bold, recognizable government or exam-related icon (such as a checklist or document symbol) subtly in the background. On the right side, include a large, bold rectangle with the key phrase. The background behind the card is a smooth gradient or simple color to keep focus clear. Incorporate a faint, national exam theme in the background to reinforce context. To ensure mobile visibility, all elements are large and clear with adequate spacing and contrast.
