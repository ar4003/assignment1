The thumbnail features a vibrant, eye-catching layout with a balanced composition. On the left side, include a large, prominent icon or image of a student holding a recent exam result sheet, with a subtle smile to evoke success. The background uses a clean, gradient blend of blue and green to symbolize trust and growth. On the right side, incorporate a bold, attention-grabbing icon such as a gold badge or checkmark to imply achievement. A slight downward tilt adds dynamism. Use a subtle shadow behind key elements for depth. Ensure all visual elements are clear and not overcrowded, with ample space around text for readability. The overall aesthetic should be modern, professional, yet engaging, designed to attract viewers on every device, especially mobile screens.
